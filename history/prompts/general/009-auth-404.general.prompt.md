## Prompt

read @[TerminalName: node, ProcessId: 3076] (Unexpected error / 404s)

## Response snapshot

Terminal shows 404 errors for `/api/auth/sign-up`. This indicates missing or misconfigured API routes. Checking `app/api` structure to verify if `app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` exists and is correct.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Identified root cause (missing route handler).
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: app/api
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create or fix the route handler.
- 🧠 Reflection: 404 on API usually means file structure matches filesystem router issue.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
